# ## INTRODUCTION

# Social media has become deeply embedded in student life, influencing their routines, mental well-being, and academic performance. This project aims to analyze patterns of social media usage among students and assess its impact through key indicators such as addiction score, mental health status, sleep hours, and platform preference. An interactive dashboard was developed using Streamlit to visualize trends and relationships across different demographics, enabling a clearer understanding of how digital behavior may shape students‚Äô daily¬†lives.

# ## OBJECTIVE

# 1. To examine the relationship between social media addiction level and their mental health status
# 2. To understand the daily usage pattern of social media among students
# 3. To compare addiction levels across genders
# 4. To identify the most preferred social media platforms among students
# 5. To determine how daily social media use impacts sleep hours
# 6. To examine the academic impact of different social media platforms 
# 
# To support a more detailed analysis, all objectives are explored using filterable data by **gender**, **academic level**, and **relationship status**. These filters are available in the sidebar of the interactive Streamlit dashboard, allowing users to view results specific to different subgroups.

# The chart shows that there is a slightly higher number of female students compared to male students in the survey just a difference by 1. This gender imbalance should be considered when interpreting results, as it may influence patterns observed in usage, addiction, and other behavior-related metrics. This chart not shown in final chart but it helps to understand the demographic distribution of the dataset.

# The scatter plot shows a negative correlation between adiction score and Mental Health Score. As students addiction to social media increases, their mental health scores tend to decrease. This indicates that higher social media addiction may be linked to poorer mental well-being. Thus, the objective examine the relationship between students social media addiction levels and mental health is achieved.

# The histogram shows how many students spend different amounts of time on social media each day. Most students use social media between 4 to 6 hours daily, indicating high usage is common. Very few students use it less that 2 or more than 8 hours daily. The objective to understand the daily usage pattern of social media among students is successfully achieved.

# The analysis shows a strong negative correlation between Addicted Score and Mental Health Score (‚àí0.95), indicating that students with higher social media addiction levels tend to give lower mental health. There is also a strong positive correlation between Addicted Score and Conflicts Over Social Media (0.93), suggesting that higher addiction is associated with more frequent social conflicts. Additionally, daily usage hours positively correlate with Addicted Score (0.83) and negatively with Sleep Hours (‚àí0.79), highlighting that students who spend more time on social media tend to sleep less. These patterns reinforce the conclusion that excessive social media use may negatively impact both mental health and sleep habits among students.

# ## CONCLUSION

# This project successfully achieved all its objectives by analyzing students social media usage and its impact. The findings show that higher addiction levels are linked to lower mental health scores and reduced sleep duration. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram are more associated with negative academic effects. Most students reported using social media for 4 to 6 hours daily. Although some charts were not included in the final dashboard, they helped support deeper understanding. Overall, the analysis highlights how excessive social media use can affect students well-being and academic performance. An interactive Streamlit dashboard was developed to present these insights clearly and allow users to explode patternd through filters and visualizations.
